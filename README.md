# Project Title

CubeRover controls will allow us to physically control a lunar rover remotely. 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To get started, you will need to have python installed in your system. 
You can download python from python.org or using Anaconda. 
To test if you installed correctly, run the following command. 

```
python
```
If the python interpretor begins, you have downloaded it successfully. 
If it gave you an error, please double check you have installed python correctly.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
